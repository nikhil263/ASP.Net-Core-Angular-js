## Start

Start by typing

`npm install`

at the level of the "package.json" file

### Option 1

Now you can just press "play" inside Visual Studio to get started.

If you change the *.ts-files you need to run the `tsc` command manually.

### Option 2

`npm start` will run the gulp task for you, starting the lite-server, the dotnet server and the tsc-watcher.
